      <p class="w3-large">There are too many categories in this pie chart which makes the visual difficult to understand. Ideally, a good pie chart should have only a few categories (3-7 is a good range) in order for the reader to easily perceive the information presented. In this instance, there seems to be hundreds of different categories, which makes the categories with the least percentages almost impossible to see.<br><br>Furthermore, colours are repeated and non-contrasting due to the excessive number of categories, making them redundant. This would cause readers to be even more confused and overwhelmed by the information.</p>

      <p class="w3-large">The variables shown in this 3D graph visual is more complicated than it needs to be. Conversely, it only makes the the information more difficult to understand and view. For example, some of the 3D bars are being blocked by others around it, especially if these bars are short. <br><br> Furthermore, the colours presented in each category are not clearly distinct from each other, making it hard for the reader to easily perceive distinct colours. This would especially be a problem for people who are colour blind, as it would be even harder for them to distinguish between slightly similar colours. Lastly, the colours used are pretty dull and lacklustre, which makes looking at the chart visually displeasing after a while</p>
